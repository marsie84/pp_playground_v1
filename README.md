Integration Playground

Usage:

You'll have to have node and npm installed - see: https://nodejs.org/en/ --> Use the LTS version 6.10.0
Once this is done, go into a local command prompt, go to the directory you've downloaded & extracted the repo to and run:

1. npm install
2. npm start

You should then see the following:

You can then access the project by opening http://localhost:8000

Enjoy! :)
